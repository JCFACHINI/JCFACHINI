### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is JoÃ£o Carlos Fachini, I'm a Braziliam Software Engineer, bachelor of Computer Science, that loves programming and interact with people.
My focus is on back-end using SOLID principles. I don't believe in a silver bullet techology or stack, each problem needs a proper tool or solution.
I have been used several languages and frameworks along my carreer (almost 14 years): PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Zend Framework, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScripe, NestJS, and many others!
